# Horiseon-Refactoring

Refactoring of existing code for marketing agency website in order to make it more accessible and easier to read by developers and search engines for SEO purposes.

The motivation of the project was to refactor the existing code with semantic HTML elements and accessibility features in order to make the webpage more accessible to screen readers and other accessibility technology. 

The semantic HTML tags were put in place to help make the code more readable for developers and improve SEO function. This project was created to practice refactoring, a duty that developers are given all time in their careers. 

The refactoring of the code with semantic HTML and accessibility attributes allowed the code to be more readily accessible and allow improvement in SEO for the webpage. 

Throughout this project, I learned the importance of semantic HTML in code. Other developers need to be able to read code without having to go back and forth between the browser to find out which lines control which elements. Accessibility is a neccesity in web development as it allows all people to access the same website without problems regarding visual impairments.
